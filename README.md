# About 

Telegram Solarized Dark Theme is a theme for Telegram Desktop v1.0 and higher.

It looks best in the environments configured to use Solarized color scheme (primary *nix systems with tiling WMs I guess).

# Install

That's very easy. Here's my method:
1. Run ```git clone git@gitlab.com:SlavMetal/hell.git```
2. Edit **colors.tdesktop-theme** using your favourite editor. 
3. Run ```./build.sh``` (or zip **colors.tdesktop-theme** and **tile.png** manually and rename it to the **Theme.tdesktop-theme**).
4. Upload archive to your Telegram cloud chat and press on this file, so you'll be asked if you want to use this theme. 

But here's also an official Telegram Support guide on how to edit and install Telegram Desktop themes: http://telegra.ph/Create-Telegram-Theme-01-12
